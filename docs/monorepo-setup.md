# Monorepo Setup & Workflow Guide

This document explains the structure of this monorepo, the reasoning behind it, and the workflow you must follow.

## 1. The Problem With the Old Setup

Your initial approach was not a monorepo. It was a "monorepo-in-name-only"â€”a collection of disconnected projects sitting in the same repository. This is the worst of both worlds and would have led to severe issues:

-   **Dependency Conflicts**: Each app had its own `package-lock.json`. It was inevitable that `cashier-app` would end up with a different version of `react` or `tailwindcss` than `account-manager-app`, leading to bugs and inconsistencies.
-   **No Code Sharing**: The primary benefit of a monorepo is sharing code (UI components, hooks, utils). The old setup made this impossible without publishing packages to a registry, which is slow and cumbersome.
-   **Maintenance Nightmare**: To update a single dependency (like `tailwindcss`), you would have had to go into each of the three app directories, run `pnpm update`, and hope you did it correctly everywhere. This is not scalable.

## 2. The Solution: A `pnpm` Workspace

A true monorepo uses a workspace manager. We use `pnpm workspaces`. This treats all the projects in the `packages/` directory as a single, cohesive system.

**The core benefits we now have are:**
-   **Single Lockfile**: One `pnpm-lock.yaml` at the root manages dependencies for the *entire* project, eliminating version conflicts.
-   **Hoisted `node_modules`**: There is only one primary `node_modules` directory at the root. `pnpm` installs all dependencies there and uses symlinks to make them available to the individual apps that need them. This is efficient and saves disk space.
-   **Unified Tooling**: You can run commands for all or some of your apps from the root directory.

## 3. The Changes Explained: What Makes This a "Real" Monorepo?

The transformation into a proper monorepo involved these key changes:

### A. `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
This file was created at the root:
```yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
```
-   **Why?** This is the declaration. It explicitly tells `pnpm` that this is a workspace and that every folder inside `/packages` is a package to be managed. This is the single most important file for enabling monorepo functionality.

### B. The Root `package.json` Was Gutted
Your old root `package.json` contained application dependencies. This was incorrect.
-   **Why was `tailwindcss` (and `react`, etc.) removed?** Because the monorepo root is **not an application**. It's a manager. `tailwindcss` is a dependency of your *applications* (`cashier-app`, etc.), not of the workspace manager itself. Dependencies must be declared in the `package.json` of the package that actually imports and uses them.
-   The only `devDependencies` that remain at the root are tools for managing the entire repository: `biome`, `husky`, `commitlint`, `typescript`, and `vite`. Keeping these here ensures you use one consistent version for linting, building, and testing across all packages.

### C. Individual `package.json` Files Remain
-   **Why wasn't the `package.json` from each app removed?** Because each package is still its own project. It needs a manifest to declare its unique properties:
    1.  Its **name** (e.g., `"name": "cashier-app"`).
    2.  Its **dependencies** (e.g., `react`, `tailwindcss`). This is how `pnpm` knows what to install for each app.
    3.  Its **scripts** (e.g., `"dev": "vite"`).

When you run `pnpm install` at the root, `pnpm` reads the `package.json` from *every single package* and builds a single dependency tree.

## 4. Your New Workflow: How to Work Now

**Always run commands from the project root.** Do not `cd` into individual package directories.

### Running Scripts
-   **Run for all apps:** `pnpm dev` (runs the `dev` script in every package).
-   **Run for one app:** `pnpm --filter <package-name> <script>`
    ```bash
    # Start the dev server for only the cashier-app
    pnpm --filter cashier-app dev
    ```

### Managing Dependencies
-   **Add a dependency to an app:** `pnpm add <dependency-name> --filter <package-name>`
    ```bash
    # Add zod to the account-manager-app
    pnpm add zod --filter account-manager-app
    ```
-   **Add a dev dependency to an app:** `pnpm add -D <dependency-name> --filter <package-name>`
    ```bash
    # Add vitest to the branchmanager-app
    pnpm add -D vitest --filter branchmanager-app
    ```

This structure is not a suggestion; it is the required workflow for this project to succeed.
